## User Centric Frontend Development Project - Ascend Gym Website


### About
Ascend Gym is a high end gymnnasium based in Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK. The main focus of the business is to offer a higher quality experience over most chain gyms, being less crowded and offering better quality equipment. The purpose of the website is to provide a place where people who want to join can register their interest, so that the gym can reach out to talk about membership options. They also want to provide basic information regarding the gym such as: Address, what to expect and when classes will be hosted at the gym. The website is made up using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 4, so the form is unable to actually send off information at this time.

### User Stories
The website has been created with different user stories in mind, this is because there are a range of criteria the website will need to be used for, please find these stories below.

* The bottom of the index page shows a video tour of the gym.

#### Join Page
* The join page contains a familar banner to the Home page, in the same style and colours to create a brand representation, with differing text.
* A form to register your interest is clearly in view, however you must scroll down to complete it.

  <br>
* Upon scrolling down you will see that there is a form to register your interest, all fields are required.
* The form again uses colours that are used throughout the site, which are easy to read and recognisable.

<br>

* If you submit your details, you will be taken to a dummy page showing that the form has been submitted, nothing happens with the details entered, as this is purely a front-end website; as I have not learned javascript yet.

  * It simply sets out the information that a prospective member, or member would need to know what classes are on when.
