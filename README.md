### About
Ascend Gym is a high end gymnnasium based in Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK. The main focus of the business is to offer a higher quality experience over most chain gyms, being less crowded and offering better quality equipment. The purpose of the website is to provide a place where people who want to join can register their interest, so that the gym can reach out to talk about membership options. They also want to provide basic information regarding the gym such as: Address, what to expect and when classes will be hosted at the gym. The website is made up using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 4, so the form is unable to actually send off information at this time.

### User Stories
The website has been created with different user stories in mind, this is because there are a range of criteria the website will need to be used for, please find these stories below.

#### Join Page
* The join page contains a familar banner to the Home page, in the same style and colours to create a brand representation, with differing text.
* A form to register your interest is clearly in view, however you must scroll down to complete it.
  ![Image of join.html page](https://github.com/darrenrob25/AscendGym_Project1/blob/main/assets/Media/join-image-1.png)
  <br>
* Upon scrolling down you will see that there is a form to register your interest, all fields are required.
* The form again uses colours that are used throughout the site, which are easy to read and recognisable.
  ![Image of join.html page](https://github.com/darrenrob25/AscendGym_Project1/blob/main/assets/Media/join-image-2.png)
<br>

* If you submit your details, you will be taken to a dummy page showing that the form has been submitted, nothing happens with the details entered, as this is purely a front-end website; as I have not learned javascript yet.

### Accessibility Testing
Accessibility testing is to check the colors and fonts, ensuring that things are easily read. For this I used the Lighthouse in the google devtools.

### Manual Testing
As part of manually testing on my own I have:
* Tested that pages work in different web browsers.
* I have tested that the project is responsive on different sized devices and functions as normal.
* I have tested all text and font, ensuring readability.
* I have tested all links, ensuring there are no deadlinks and all work correctly.

### Bugs
During building of the site, bugs reared their head on a few occassions, below are those occassions and how I fixed the problem.

#### Bug 1
The first bug that I encountered had to do with the header, on mobile devices the pages would drop down to a second line. However, this line was behind the hero image. Making it impossible to navigate on mobile.
I fixed this by adding a padding while on a mobile device to push the navigation bar down, creating more room for the pages.

Code After:
```@media only screen and (max-width: 982px){
    #navigation-bar{
        padding-bottom: 125px;
    }
    }
```

#### Bug 2
The second bug that I encountered is that nav links were overlapping when at a galaxy fold size, there were two ways in which this could have been rectified, the first would be a burger dropdown menu. However, I was unsure on how to do these and I couldn't find an example which didn't include javascript. Therefore, I decided to make the text smaller at this device size. Adding a burger menu may be a good idea in the future.

Code After:

```@media(max-width: 320px){ 
body{
    font-size: 12px;
}
```

#### Bug 3
The third bug that I encountered was that the signup form on mobile was way too think, this was due to the margins on the right and left being too great for a mobile device; to fix this I added some code within the mobile media query.

Code After:
```@media only screen and (max-width: 982px){
 .form-background{
        background-image: url("../images/signup-background-img.jpg");
        margin-left: 5%;
        margin-right: 5%;
        padding-bottom: 20px;
        padding-top: 20px;
        margin-top: 30px;
        margin-bottom: 30px;
        border-radius: 10px;
        border: solid 2px #F17F29;
    }
}
```
